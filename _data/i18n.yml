    # These are the concrete examples of our theme, "What kind of King is this?"
    # They are questions meant to challenge the idea of a king, or authority, of power.
    # We pose these questions throughout the website (as well as on our print and digital media)
    # to get people to ponder on who and what Jesus is.
    # Each question is separated into two fields:
    # 1. question: This is the actual unique part of the question. It will be prefixed by the
    #              prefixes.questions defined earlier.
    # 3. answer: This is the explanation for the question. It should be clear and concise, but also
    #            ideally reference the Bible.

      The objective of Jesus Week 2019 is simple: a desperate and urgent plea to our fellow students at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University to consider the reality of hell and the saving work of Jesus Christ on the cross for sinners like ourselves.

      We don’t believe that we, in our own individual power and wisdom, can convert anyone, but our desire is to make known to all the grace and mercy of Jesus, who stood in our place at Calvary and died the death that we deserved. Whoever should repent and trust in Jesus will be saved.

      We plead with you; hell is real, heaven is real, time is short; you must choose how you will respond.
