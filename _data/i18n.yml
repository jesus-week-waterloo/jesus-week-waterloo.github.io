  explanation:
    # This is our explanation for our theme. It's split into several sections, each corresponding
    # to a specific visual effect.
    preamble:
      en-ca: |
        Jesus is the one with total authority, given by God, in Heaven and on Earth.
      zh-hk: |
        ...
    preamble-verse:
      source:
        en-ca: Ephesians 1:20-21
        zh-hk: ...
      text:
        en-ca: >
          God raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far
          above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named,
          not only in this age but also in the one to come.
        zh-hk: >
          ...
    authority-p1:
      en-ca: |
        The authority of Jesus can be witnessed through his triumph over nature, illness,
        forgiveness of sins, and even death. We see accounts of his authority over nature when he
        controls the wind and seas to calm a storm, over illness when he heals blindness, over sin
        when pours out mercy, and over death when he rose from the grave.

            Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?

            He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was
            with Him.

          en-ca: >
            What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and
            they obey Him.
          zh-hk: >

      - source:
          en-ca: Luke 24:6-7
          zh-hk: ...
        text:
          en-ca: >
            He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in
            Galilee: ‘The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified
            and on the third day be raised again.’
          zh-hk: >
            ...
    authority-p2:
      en-ca: |
        Jesus has all authority and all power. He is, furthermore, all holy and righteous (Romans
        3:10). He is the one who is fully right to judge us, but instead of judging us, he offers
        us eternal life. This tremendously contradicts our expectation of a king.
      zh-hk: |
        ...
    suffering:
      en-ca: |
        Jesus is not a king who turns away to those who are suffering or demands to be served as
        the world’s authority figures expect to be. Rather, he experiences our suffering and cares
        (Hebrews 2:18). Jesus, with all authority, emptied himself of his glory and took on the
        role of a servant. As seen in the accounts of his authority on Earth, he is patient,
        compassionate, and merciful to those who are helpless. Jesus sees the need in people. He
        sees us so clearly in our brokenness, yet, Jesus is the King who died for us, so that we
        may be reconciled to God (2 Corinthians 5:17-18).
      zh-hk: |
        ...
    conclusion:
      en-ca: |
        He is so powerful, howbeit so loving and tender. He is Lord of lords and King of kings
        (Revelation 17:14), and the good shepherd who lays down His life for His sheep (John
        10:11). Jesus is the promised King, the one who will save, who will rule, who will redeem.
        He is the way, and the truth, and the life. (John 14:6).

  description:
    en-ca: |
      The objective of Jesus Week 2019 is simple: a desperate and urgent plea to our fellow
      students at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University to consider the reality
      of hell and the saving work of Jesus Christ on the cross for sinners like ourselves.

      We don’t believe that we, in our own individual power and wisdom, can convert anyone, but our
      desire is to make known to all the grace and mercy of Jesus, who stood in our place at
      Calvary and died the death that we deserved. Whoever should repent and trust in Jesus will
      be saved.

      We plead with you; hell is real, heaven is real, time is short; you must choose how you will
      respond.

      Whether you're a fully professing Christian, just started on your spiritual journey, or
      interested in learning more about Jesus, we strongly encourage you to go to a church and join
      a fellowship. You'll find a community of like-minded, Gospel-centred believers in Christ that
      will answer your questions, keep you accountable, and guide you in growing your faith.
