## <mark>Our Mission:</mark> *To make Christ known on the campuses.*

## <mark>Our Vision:</mark> *Gospel centred unity across the fellowships for the salvation of the campuses.*

> *Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.*
> <p class="text-right">&mdash; 2 Corinthians 5:20-21</p>

The objective of Jesus Week 2019 is simple: a desperate and urgent plea to our fellow students at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University to consider the reality of hell and the saving work of Jesus Christ on the cross for sinners like ourselves.

We don't believe that we, in our own individual power and wisdom, can convert anyone, but our desire is to make known to all the grace and mercy of Jesus, who stood in our place at Calvary and died the death that we deserved. Whoever should repent and trust in Jesus will be saved.

We plead with you; hell is real, heaven is real, time is short; you must choose how you will respond.
